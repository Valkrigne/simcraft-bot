# Simcraft-bot
SimulationCraft Bot for discord.

This is the home of Simcraft-bot which can be found on several World of Warcraft related Discord servers.
This heavily modified fork of https://github.com/stokbaek/simc-discord aims to serve those that don't know how or don't have the hardware to run their own bot.
If you want to invite Simcraft-bot to your own server head over to https://discord.gg/Z7nahTp or if you are looking at running your own bot you should use the main repo (simc-discord) which is better suited for normal usage and is tested on multiple systems.

Do note that this code should not be considered production ready and may contain bugs and security issues.

The following things are needed to run the bot:
* Python 3.5+
* Python Discord lib: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
* Webservice on the server to hand out a link to the finished simulation.
* A working version of simulationcraft
* Blizzard API key (This is needed to use armory): https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/BattleArmoryAPI
